Mapotic enables anyone to build custom maps focused on rich content, structured data categorisation & filtering, social features, crowdsourcing and community engagement. Map projects can be launched as standalone project, mobile application or embedded into websites.

== Description ==
Mapotic was created to provide users with a flexible solution that would integrate social interactions into digital maps. Individuals, communities and businesses can create custom maps to fulfil their missions, as leverage to improve marketing effectiveness or to drive additional revenue.

Anyone can create a free map and customise it for their own mapping purposes. A powerful admin panel enables administrators to set up maps ranging in complexity from private projects that are local/team based, to large community maps involving the participation of thousands of users. Mapotic supports both business and social features - you can choose if you want to use map for your enterprise or create a community project and let others rate, comment, add photos, contribute with their content etc.

Free projects can run on Mapotic or be integrated into websites and apps. Owners of larger scale projects can create their own white labeled map on a custom domain or create their own branded mobile app.
